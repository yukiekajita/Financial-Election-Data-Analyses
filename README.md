Python Challenge HW Repo

## PyBank

* In this challenge, I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company with a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 

* I created a Python script that analyzed the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
  
 ## PyPoll

* In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

* With a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv), I created a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
